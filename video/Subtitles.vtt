Hi everyone! My name is Krishanu, and today I’ll&nbsp;
be giving a demo on how to use my group’s tool:&nbsp;&nbsp;

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.560
the Spotify Recommendation Visualization.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.460
Our visualization has two linked,&nbsp;
interactive visual encodings.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.000
On the left there is a scatter plot of&nbsp;
a various selection of songs available&nbsp;&nbsp;

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.980
on Spotify. The axes of the graph represent&nbsp;
various song attributes. At the beginning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.560
the axes of the graph are set to loudness on&nbsp;
the y-axis and danceability on the x-axis.

7
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420
On the right, there is a bar chart displaying the&nbsp;
distribution of available markets of the songs&nbsp;&nbsp;

8
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.400
shown in the scatter plot on the left. The bar&nbsp;
chart shows that the top market is US followed&nbsp;&nbsp;

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.580
closely by Canada and Mexico. This means that all&nbsp;
2000 songs in the sample are available in the US.

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.900
The user is able to change the axes&nbsp;
of the scatterplot to create different&nbsp;&nbsp;

11
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.380
visualizations. For instance, if the&nbsp;
user wanted to find songs with high&nbsp;&nbsp;

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.420
tempo and energy, they could select&nbsp;
those as axes for the scatterplot.

13
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.280
When a user hovers over a&nbsp;
point in the scatterplot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

14
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.540
a tooltip appears showing the user the track&nbsp;
name, album name and release year of the song.&nbsp;&nbsp;

15
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.280
At the same time, the bars of the countries&nbsp;
that specific song is available in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

16
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.440
light up green in the bar&nbsp;
chart encoding on the right.

17
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.460
When a user hovers over a bar in the bar chart,&nbsp;
the number of songs from the total sample of&nbsp;&nbsp;

18
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.940
2000 songs that are available in the country&nbsp;
represented by the bar will appear via a tooltip.

19
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.340
For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

20
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.980
there are 1920 songs available&nbsp;
in Mexico in the sample.

21
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.520
Finally, the user is able to identify how old&nbsp;&nbsp;

22
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.360
songs are based on the lightness of the&nbsp;
green of the points in the scatterplot.
